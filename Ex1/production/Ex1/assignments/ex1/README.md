This is my first Java assignment in github
for the Intro to Introduction to calculus course.

The project creates a simple tool
that helps convert numbers between different bases (2-16)
and do basic math operations.

I wrote functions to check if numbers are valid,
add and multiply them,
and find the biggest number in a set.

The program runs in the console
and lets you input numbers, convert them, and see results.

I also wrote JUnit tests
that ensure the correctness of our number conversion methods
by testing different tape and conversion scenarios.
